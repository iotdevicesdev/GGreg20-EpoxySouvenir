# GGreg20_ES - Souvenir Geiger Counter
You are reading the description of an unusual art product: on the one hand, it is embedded DIY electronics, on the other hand, it is a product that is non-functional by design. If you decide to order such a souvenir, you will participate in two charitable initiatives with the IoT-devices team.

**Please note**! This product is not a working Geiger counter, but only a souvenir. If you were looking for GGreg20_V3, such a module can be ordered at the [link](https://github.com/iotdevicesdev/GGreg20-EpoxySouvenir/tree/main#related-radiation-detection-applications-links).

## How it started
To manufacture these souvenirs, we deliberately purchase non-functional Geiger tubes on the Ukrainian market that could be sold on the global DIY market as part of commercial products. As participants in the DIY market, we see how the same broken or exhausted tubes are resold several times from hand to hand, because no one wants to lose potential profit.

Also, rejected boards of the popular GGreg20 module of various versions and from various stages of production are used in our GGreg20 Epoxy Souvenir project.

## How it's going
As a result, we get a transparent block of epoxy resin, which contains a forever preserved GGreg20 module with a Geiger tube inside.

The epoxy resin casting guarantees that this time the Geiger tube will not return to the gray market of DIY radio components.

- So, by purchasing a souvenir, you help to clean up the market from unscrupulous commercial offers and participate in the initiative to improve the quality of amateur solutions on a global scale. After all, the tubes from the Soviet reserves, which are discussed in this project, are distributed to Western countries and end up in the devices of thousands of radio amateurs.

- What is the second initiative? We decided to donate half of the profits generated under this project to charity and support defense projects in Ukraine. We believe that in the context of the aggressive and unprovoked war that is now being waged against Ukraine, any charitable initiative is important and timely.

So, by ordering this souvenir as a keepsake, you are also donating to Ukraine.
